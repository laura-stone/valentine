			<h1>Valentine's Day Is A Thing</h1>
			<p>A lot of people seem to find it important. I don't really get that, but, you know, whatever. Gotta keep them peoplez happy. Gotta keep em all lovey-dovey and shit. So <a href="form.html">make a valentine</a> with this site. It's got some text right now but that ain't shit. Probably would do best to replace this at a later time with, you know, content. Some one else can come up with that content. I guess I'm not so into content.</p>

			<p>Anyway, go ahead and <a href="form.html">click here if you want to make a valentine</a> for that someone special. Otherwise, hang out here, or <a href="about.html">click here</a> to learn more about the strange human that made this. You can also use the navigation bar to do this, but, again, whatever.</p>
